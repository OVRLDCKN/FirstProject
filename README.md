<h2>What is this Project?</h2>
This Project is basically just my first Project on GitHub :D<br>
I will use it, to test, if i can use it to work on a Project from multiple Computers, and if I can publish the Project
<h2>Do you have other Projects?</h2>
<strong>YES I DO</strong> But they are not uploaded on Github
<h2>Is the Code Copyrighted?</h2>
No, It is not Copyrighted, since I will never have the chance<em>(if I wanted to sue you)</em>, to prove, that you have taken Code from a little Project like this<br>
If you do hovever take some of my Code, I would really appreciate, if you tell me, so that I know, that I should continue publishing Code to Github<br>
<strong><em>FEEL FREE TO ASK ME, TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR CODES, OR TO PUBLISH AN EXAMPLE CODE OF SOMETHING</em></strong>
